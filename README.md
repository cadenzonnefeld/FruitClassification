Fruit Classification

The aim of this project was to perform a computer vision task of identifying the label associated with a given fruit image. Through my analysis, I quickly learned the immense power of neural networks as the classifiers were able to quickly learn (and even) perfect the provided dataset with labeled images of fruits.

Next steps for this project would include desinging a more robust fruit classifier that could identify fruits amidst more complicated images. This model would likely have a use case in the food supply chain or even in supermarkets.
