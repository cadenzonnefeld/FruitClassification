Fruit Classification

The aim of this project was to perform a computer vision task of identifying the label associated with a given fruit image. Through my analysis, I quickly learned the immense power of neural networks as the classifiers were able to quickly learn (and even) perfect the provided dataset with labeled images of fruits.
